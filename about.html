            who were active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, Morrissey has had a solo career, making the top ten of the UK Singles Chart on ten occasions and reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart three times. In 1988, Morrissey launched his solo career with <em>Viva Hate</em>. He took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, <em>You Are the Quarry</em>, in 2004.  In November 2017, Morrissey announced his first UK tour since 2015. The tour begins in Aberdeen and concludes in London in November 2018 for his latest release <em>Low in High School</em>.
            </p><br /><p>Morrissey has been credited as a seminal figure in the emergence of indie rock and Britpop.  Acclaimed as one of the greatest lyricists in British history, his lyrics have become the subject of academic study.  In 2006, Morrissey was voted the second greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC’s <em>Culture Show</em>.  Named  one of the ten greatest singers of all time in a 2012 <em>Rolling Stone</em> poll, noted that his “rejection of convention” in his vocal style and lyrics is the reason “why he redefined the sound of British rock for the past quarter-century”.</p>
